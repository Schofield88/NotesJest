# Notes App mk 2

## Objective

Revisit the Makers Notes App week, this time using Jest and all the other cool stuff I've learnt since.

## Setup

Clone the repository, then at the command line run:

```npm install```

to install dependencies. To run the tests:

```npm run test```


## Design choices and assumptions

The first time through for this particular week at Makers was only the second week I'd ever spent with JavaScript. As such, some of the testing was questionable and progress on the week was limited. This revisit is an attempt to codify my understanding of OO principles and to correctly test-drive the creation of code.
